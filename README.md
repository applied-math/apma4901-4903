# APMA majors seminar

[This site](https://applied-math.github.io/apma4901-4903/) is for the 
Junior (4901) and Senior (4903) Seminar.
For decades, the seminar has brought together
juniors and seniors majoring in applied mathematics
from across the undergraduate divisions [^div].

Juniors get a chance to learn the variety of research
and career paths afforded by majoring in applied mathematics
at Columbia. Seniors get a chance to sharpen their focus by
divising, working in collaboration with the professor, a
research presentation on material of their choosing and interest.
This material can overlap with exisitng supervised research
(e.g., via APMA3900) or can be used to design a research program
to be executed in their 8th semester.

For more detailed intructions on the goals, expectations, and obligations of the junior and senior seminar, please see:

[^div]: Applied Mathematics is a *University Major*, meaning that your peers will be from other undergraduate divisions, including SEAS, CC, BC, GS and JTS.
